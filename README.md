### Description

This is the updated and greatly improved version of a job orgainizer that I had submitted last month. You can keep track of job prospects, saving the info in an Access database. You can search on any field. There is a query builder to build SQL queries for you, and it saves all the queries that you build. You can view and edit the saved Sql statements. It has a follow up reminder to let you know when you need to contact people. It prints a couple of basic reports. I found this program very useful in my last job search. I hope that you like it. Please let me know if you do or if you have suggestions to improve it.
